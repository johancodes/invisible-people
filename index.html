      <h2>Demo: Become Invisible</h2>
      <p>Try this out using your webcam. Click on button below and wait a few seconds for the model to load. Stand about three feet away from your webcam and start walking around in front of the camera. <i>Watch as you rapidly disappear from the live video feed.</i></p>
      <p>Note that non-human objects will still be seen moving in the background as normal. Best used in well-lit environments. Best experienced on a desktop computer. This demo has been repurposed by <a href="http://joellim.squarespace.com/">Joel Lim</a> based on code written by <a href="https://github.com/jasonmayes/Real-Time-Person-Removal">Jason Mayes</a> who produced this using Google's TensorFlow.js machine learning cloud platform.</p>
